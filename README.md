## Motivation
As I was doing my research, oftentimes I have to qualitatively perform benchmarking with images shown in the existing literature. 
It's tedious work to manually scan through images in the dataset to find the exact same image as shown in other papers. 
Thus, the objective of this project is to create a minimal web ui that allows me to quickly take a snapshot of the image from papers and perform searching via 
encoded embedding distance.
